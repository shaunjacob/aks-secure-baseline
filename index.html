## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Secure Baseline Reference Implementation

This reference implementation demonstrates the _recommended starting (baseline) infrastructure architecture_ for an [AKS cluster](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service). This is implementation and document is meant to guide an interdisciplinary team or multiple distinct teams like networking, security and development through the process of getting this secure baseline infrastructure deployed and understanding the components of it.

## Azure Architecture Center guidance

This project has a companion set of articles that describe challenges, design patterns, and best practices for a secure AKS cluster. You can find this article on the Azure Architecture Center at [Baseline architecture for a secure AKS cluster](https://aka.ms/architecture/aks-baseline). If you haven't reviewed it, we suggest you read it as it will give added context to the considerations applied in this implementation. Ultimately, this is the direct implementation of that specific architectural guidance.

# The Architecture

.left-column[
  # Architecture
]
.right-column[

**This architecture is infrastructure focused**, more so than workload. It concentrates on the AKS cluster itself, including concerns with identity, post-deployment configuration, secret management, and network topologies.

The implementation presented here is the _minimum recommended baseline for most AKS clusters_. This implementation integrates with Azure services that will deliver observability, provide a network topology that will support multi-regional growth, and keep the in-cluster traffic secure as well. This architecture should be considered your starting point for pre-production and production stages.

Throughout the reference implementation, you will see reference to _Contoso Bicycle_. They are a fictional small and fast-growing startup that provides online web services to its clientele on the west coast of North America. They have no on-premises data centers and all their containerized line of business applications are now about to be orchestrated by secure, enterprise-ready AKS clusters. You can read more about [their requirements and their IT team composition](./contoso-bicycle/README.md). This narrative provides grounding for some implementation details, naming conventions, etc. You should adapt as you see fit.

Finally, this implementation uses the [ASP.NET Core Docker sample web app](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/tree/master/samples/aspnetapp) as an example workload. This workload purposefully uninteresting, as it is here exclusively to help you experience the baseline infrastructure.

A deployment of AKS-hosted workloads typically experiences a separation of duties and lifecycle management in the area of prerequisites, the host network, the cluster infrastructure, and finally the workload itself. This reference implementation is similar. Also, be aware our primary purpose is to illustrate the topology and decisions of a baseline cluster. We feel a "step-by-step" flow will help you learn the pieces of the solution and give you insight into the relationship between them. Ultimately, lifecycle/SDLC management of your cluster and its dependencies will depend on your situation (team roles, organizational standards, etc), and will be implemented as appropriate for your needs.

**Please start this learning journey in the _Preparing for the cluster_ section.** If you follow this through the end, you'll have our recommended baseline cluster installed, with an end-to-end sample workload running for you to reference in your own Azure subscription.

In the following sections we will cover:
1. Preparing for the cluster
1. Build target network
1. Deploying the cluster
1. Deploy your workload
1. Validation

### Steps

1. An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).

   > Important: the user or service principal initiating the deployment process must have the following minimal set of Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles and Azure AD permissions assigned:
   >
   > * [Contributor role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) is required at the subscription level to have the ability to create resource groups and perform deployments.
   > * [User Access Administrator role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) is required at the subscription level since you'll be granting least-privilege RBAC access to resources as well as assigning built-in policy definitions to your AKS cluster.
   >   * One such example is detailed in the [Container Insights documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/container-insights-troubleshoot#authorization-error-during-onboarding-or-update-operation).
   > * Azure AD [User Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#user-administrator-permissions).
   >   * If you are not part of the User Administrator group in the tenant associated to your Azure subscription, please consider [creating a new tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant#create-a-new-tenant-for-your-organization) to use while evaluating this implementation.

   1. [Register the required Azure Policy features for AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes#install-azure-policy-add-on-for-aks).
4\. Clone/download this repo locally, or even better fork this repository.

   > Note: If you have forked this reference implementation repo, you'll be able to customize some of the files and commands for a more personalized experience; also ensure references to repos mentioned are updated to use your own (e.g. the following `GITHUB_REPO`).

  ##### Generate Your Client-Facing and AKS Ingress Controller TLS Certificates
]

.right-column[
### Steps

1. Generate a client-facing self-signed TLS certificate

   > Contoso Bicycle needs to procure a CA certificate for the web site. As this is going to be a user-facing site, they purchase an EV cert from their CA.  This will serve in front of the Azure Application Gateway.  They will also procure another one, a standard cert, to be used with the AKS Ingress Controller. This one is not EV, as it will not be user facing.

   Warning: Do not use the certificate created by this script for actual deployments. The use of self-signed certificates are provided for ease of illustration purposes only. For your cluster, use your organization's requirements for procurement and lifetime management of TLS certificates, _even for development purposes_.

   Create the certificate for Azure Application Gateway with a common name of `bicycle.contoso.com`.

   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -out appgw.crt -keyout appgw.key -subj "/CN=bicycle.contoso.com/O=Contoso Bicycle"
   openssl pkcs12 -export -out appgw.pfx -in appgw.crt -inkey appgw.key -passout pass:

2\. Base64 encode the client-facing certificate

   Note: No matter if you used a certificate from your organization or you generated one from above, you'll need the certificate (as `.pfx`) to be base 64 encoded for proper storage in Key Vault later.

   ```bash
   export APP_GATEWAY_LISTENER_CERTIFICATE=$(cat appgw.pfx | base64 | tr -d '\n')
   ```

3\. Generate the wildcard certificate for the AKS Ingress Controller

   > Note: Contoso Bicycle will also procure another TLS certificate, a standard cert, to be used with the AKS Ingress Controller. This one is not EV, as it will not be user facing. Finally the app team decides to use a wildcard certificate of `*.aks-ingress.contoso.com` for the ingress controller.

   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -out traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.crt -keyout traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.key -subj "/CN=*.aks-ingress.contoso.com/O=Contoso Aks Ingress"

### Steps

> Note: The Contoso Bicycle Azure AD team requires all admin access to AKS clusters be security-group based. This applies to the new Secure AKS cluster that is being built for Application ID a0008 under the BU001 business unit. Kubernetes RBAC will be AAD-backed and access granted based on a user's identity or directory group membership.

1. Query and save your Azure subscription tenant id

   ```bash
   export TENANT_ID=$(az account show --query tenantId --output tsv)
   ```

1. Login into the tenant where you are a Azure AD User Administrator playing the role as the Contoso Bicycle Azure AD team

   ```bash
   az login --tenant <replace-with-tenant-id-with-user-admin-permissions> --allow-no-subscriptions
   export K8S_RBAC_AAD_PROFILE_TENANTID=$(az account show --query tenantId --output tsv)

.right-column[
3\. Create the first the Azure AD group that is going to map the Kubernetes Cluster Role Admin. If you already have a security group that is appropriate for cluster admins, consider using that group and skipping this step. If using your own group, you will need to update group object names throughout the reference implementation.

   ```bash
   K8S_RBAC_AAD_PROFILE_ADMIN_GROUP_OBJECTID=$(az ad group create --display-name aad-to-bu0001a000800-cluster-admin --mail-nickname aad-to-bu0001a000800-cluster-admin --query objectId -o tsv)
   ```

4\. Create a break-glass Cluster Admin user for your AKS cluster

   > Note: The organization knows the value of having a break-glass admin user for their critical infrastructure. The app team requests a cluster admin user and Azure AD Admin team proceeds with the creation of the user from Azure AD.

   ```bash
   K8S_RBAC_AAD_PROFILE_TENANT_DOMAIN_NAME=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query 'userPrincipalName' | cut -d '@' -f 2 | sed 's/\"//')
   AKS_ADMIN_OBJECTID=$(az ad user create --display-name=bu0001a0008-admin --user-principal-name bu0001a0008-admin@${K8S_RBAC_AAD_PROFILE_TENANT_DOMAIN_NAME} --force-change-password-next-login --password ChangeMebu0001a0008AdminChangeMe --query objectId -o tsv)

5\. Add the new admin user to new security group so can be granted with the Kubernetes Cluster Admin role.

   > Note: The recently created break-glass admin user is added to the Kubernetes Cluster Admin group from Azure AD. After this step the Azure AD Admin team will have finished the app team's request and the outcome are:
   >
   > * the new app team's user admin credentials

   >

   ```bash
   az ad group member add --group aad-to-bu0001a000800-cluster-admin --member-id $AKS_ADMIN_OBJECTID
   ```

   This object ID will be used later while creating the cluster. This way, once the cluster gets deployed the new group will get the proper Cluster Role bindings in Kubernetes.

6\. Set up groups to map into other Kubernetes Roles. (Optional, fork required)

   > Note: The team knows there will be more than just cluster admins that need group-managed access to the cluster.  Out of the box, Kubernetes has other roles like _admin_, _edit_, and _view_ which can also be mapped to Azure AD Groups.

   In the [`user-facing-cluster-role-aad-group.yaml` file](./cluster-baseline-settings/user-facing-cluster-role-aad-group.yaml), you can replace the four `<replace-with-an-aad-group-object-id-for-this-cluster-role-binding>` placeholders with corresponding new or existing AD groups that map to their purpose for this cluster.

   Note: Alternatively, you can make these group associations to [Azure RBAC roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/manage-azure-rbac). At the time of this writing, this feature is still in _preview_, but will become the preferred way of mapping identities to Kubernetes RBAC roles.

5\. Create the spoke that will be home to the AKS cluster and its adjacent resources.

   > Note:  The networking team receives a request from an app team in business unit (BU) 0001 for a network spoke to house their new AKS-based application (Internally know as Application ID: A0008). The network team talks with the app team to understand their requirements and aligns those needs with Microsoft's best practices for a secure AKS cluster deployment. They capture those specific requirements and deploy the spoke, aligning to those specs, and connecting it to the matching regional hub.

   ```bash
   # [This takes about ten minutes to run.]
   HUB_VNET_ID=$(az deployment group show -g rg-enterprise-networking-hubs -n hub-default --query properties.outputs.hubVnetId.value -o tsv)

   ```

   The spoke creation will emit the following:

     * `appGwPublicIpAddress` - The Public IP address of the Azure Application Gateway (WAF) that will receive traffic for your workload.
     * `clusterVnetResourceId` - The resource ID of the VNet that the cluster will land in. E.g. `/subscriptions/[subscription id]/resourceGroups/rg-enterprise-networking-spokes/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-hub-spoke-BU0001A0008-00`
     * `nodepoolSubnetResourceIds` - An array containing the subnet resource IDs of the AKS node pools in the spoke. E.g. `["/subscriptions/[subscription id]/resourceGroups/rg-enterprise-networking-spokes/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-hub-spoke-BU0001A0008-00/subnets/snet-clusternodes"]`

6\. Update the shared, regional hub deployment to account for the requirements of the spoke.

   > Note: Now that their hub has its first spoke, the hub can no longer run off of the generic hub template. The networking team creates a named hub template (e.g. `hub-eastus2.json`) to forever represent this specific hub and the features this specific hub needs in order to support its spokes' requirements. As new spokes are attached and new requirements arise for the regional hub, they will be added to this template file.

   ```bash
   # [This takes about three minutes to run.]
   NODEPOOL_SUBNET_RESOURCEIDS=$(az deployment group show -g rg-enterprise-networking-spokes -n spoke-BU0001A0008 --query properties.outputs.nodepoolSubnetResourceIds.value -o tsv)
   az deployment group create --resource-group rg-enterprise-networking-hubs --template-file networking/hub-regionA.json --parameters location=eastus2 nodepoolSubnetResourceIds="['${NODEPOOL_SUBNET_RESOURCEIDS}']"
   ```

   > Note: At this point the networking team has delivered a spoke in which BU 0001's app team can lay down their AKS cluster (ID: A0008). The networking team provides the necessary information to the app team for them to reference in their Infrastructure-as-Code artifacts.
   >
   > Hubs and spokes are controlled by the networking team's GitHub Actions workflows. This automation is not included in this reference implementation as this body of work is focused on the AKS baseline and not the networking team's CI/CD practices.

1. Create the AKS cluster resource group.

   > Note: The app team working on behalf of business unit 0001 (BU001) is looking to create an AKS cluster of the app they are creating (Application ID: 0008). They have worked with the organization's networking team and have been provisioned a spoke network in which to lay their cluster and network-aware external resources into (such as Application Gateway). They took that information and added it to their [`cluster-stamp.json`](./cluster-stamp.json) and [`azuredeploy.parameters.prod.json`](./azuredeploy.parameters.prod.json) files.
   >
   > They create this resource group to be the parent group for the application.

.right-column[
2\. Get the AKS cluster spoke VNet resource ID.

   > Note: The app team will be deploying to a spoke VNet, that was already provisioned by the network team.

   ```bash
   TARGET_VNET_RESOURCE_ID=$(az deployment group show -g rg-enterprise-networking-spokes -n spoke-BU0001A0008 --query properties.outputs.clusterVnetResourceId.value -o tsv)
   ```

3\. Deploy the cluster ARM template.  
  Note: By default, this deployment will allow unrestricted access to your cluster's API Server.  You can limit access to the API Server to a set of well-known IP addresses (i.,e. your hub firewall IP, bastion subnet, build agents, or any other networks you'll administer the cluster from) by setting the `clusterAuthorizedIPRanges` parameter in all deployment options.  

   **Option 1 - Deploy in the Azure Portal**

   Use the following deploy to Azure button to create the baseline cluster from the Azure Portal. You'll need to provide the parameter values as returned from prior steps in this guide.

GitOps allows a team to author Kubernetes manifest files, persist them in their git repo, and have them automatically apply to their cluster as changes occur.  This reference implementation is focused on the baseline cluster, so Flux is managing cluster-level concerns . This is distinct from workload-level concerns, which would be possible as well to manage via Flux, and would typically be done by additional Flux operators in the cluster. The namespace `cluster-baseline-settings` will be used to provide a logical division of the cluster configuration from workload configuration.  Examples of manifests that are applied:

* Cluster Role Bindings for the AKS-managed Azure AD integration
* AAD Pod Identity
* CSI driver and Azure KeyVault CSI Provider
* the workload's namespace named `a0008`

3\. Get AKS `kubectl` credentials (as a user that has admin permissions to the cluster).

   > In the [Azure Active Directory Integration](03-aad.md) step, we placed our cluster under AAD group-backed RBAC. This is the first time we are seeing this used. `az aks get-credentials` allows you to use `kubectl` commands against your cluster. Without the AAD integration, you'd have to use `--admin` here, which isn't what we want to happen. Here, you'll log in with a user that has been added to the Azure AD security group used to back the Kubernetes RBAC admin role. Executing the command below will invoke the AAD login process to auth the _user of your choice_, which will then be checked against Kubernets RBAC to perform the action. The user you choose to log in with _must be a member of the AAD group bound_ to the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole. For simplicity could either use the "break-glass" admin user created in [Azure Active Directory Integration](03-aad.md) (`bu0001a0008-admin`) or any user you assign to the `cluster-admin` group assignment in your [`user-facing-cluster-role-aad-group.yaml`](cluster-baseline-settings/user-facing-cluster-role-aad-group.yaml) file. If you skipped those steps you can use `--admin` to proceed, but proper AAD group-based RBAC access is a critical security function that you should invest time in setting up.

Generally speaking, this will be the last time you should need to use `kubectl` for day-to-day configuration operations on this cluster (outside of break-fix situations).

We have provided some sample deployment scripts that you could adapt for your own purposes while doing a POC/spike on this. Those scripts are found in the [inner-loop-scripts directory](./inner-loop-scripts). They include some additional considerations and may include some additional narrative as well. Consider checking them out. They consolidate most of the walk-through performed above into combined execution steps.

## Preview features
]

While this reference implementation tends to avoid _preview_ features of AKS to ensure you have the best customer support experience; there are some features you may wish to evaluate in pre-production clusters that augment your posture around security, manageability, etc. Consider trying out and providing feedback on the following. As these features come out of preview, this reference implementation may be updated to incorporate them.

* [Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/manage-azure-rbac) - An extension of the Azure AD integration already in this reference implementation. Allowing you to bind Kubernetes authentication to Azure RBAC role assignments.
* [Host-based encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/enable-host-encryption) - Leverages added data encryption on your VMs' temp and OS disks.
* [Node image upgrades](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/node-image-upgrade) - Built-in OS patch management; replacement for BYO solutions, such as Kured used in this reference implementation.
* [AKS Ubuntu 18.04](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/cluster-configuration#os-configuration-preview) - Will be the default starting in AKS 1.18.
* [Containerd support](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/cluster-configuration#container-runtime-configuration-preview) - Replaces the use of Moby with Containerd directly, reducing node resource consumption and improving startup latency.
* [Generation 2 VM support](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/cluster-configuration#generation-2-virtual-machines-preview) - Increased memory options, Intel SGX support, and UEFI-based boot architectures.

## Advanced topics

.right-column[

This reference implementation intentionally does not cover more advanced scenarios. For example topics like the following are not addressed:

* Cluster lifecycle management with regard to SDLC and GitOps
* Workload SDLC integration (including concepts like [DevSpaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dev-spaces/), advanced deployment techniques, etc)
* Mapping decisions to [CIS benchmark controls](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/)
* Container security
* Multi-region clusters
* [Advanced regulatory compliance](https://github.com/Azure/sg-aks-workshop) (FinServ)
* Multiple (related or unrelated) workloads owned by the same team
* Multiple workloads owned by disparate teams (AKS as a shared platform in your organization)
* Cluster-contained state (PVC, etc)
* Windows node pools
* Scale-to-zero node pools and event-based scaling (KEDA)
* [Private Kubernetes API Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/private-clusters)
* [Terraform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/terraform/create-k8s-cluster-with-tf-and-aks)
* [Bedrock](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock)
* [dapr](https://github.com/dapr/dapr)

Keep watching this space, as we build out reference implementation guidance on topics such as these. Further guidance delivered will use this baseline AKS implementation as their starting point. If you would like to contribute or suggest a pattern built on this baseline, [please get in touch](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

  ## Final thoughts

.right-column[

Kubernetes is a very flexible platform, giving infrastructure and application operators many choices to achieve their business and technology objectives. At points along your journey, you will need to consider when to take dependencies on Azure platform features, OSS solutions, support channels, regulatory compliance, and operational processes. **We encourage this reference implementation to be the place for you to _start_ architectural conversations within your own team; adapting to your specific requirements, and ultimately delivering a solution that delights your customers.**
